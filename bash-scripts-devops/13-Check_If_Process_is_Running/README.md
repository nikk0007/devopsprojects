The "ps -aux" command is used to display information about active processes running on the system. When executed, it provides a tabular output with several columns. Here's an explanation of each column:

USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.0    916   536 ?        Sl   18:36   0:00 /init
root         8  0.0  0.0   1264   364 ?        Ss   18:36   0:00 /init
root         9  0.0  0.0   1272   364 ?        S    18:36   0:01 /init
nikk        10  0.0  0.0   6164  5240 pts/0    Ss   18:36   0:00 -bash

USER: This column displays the username or user ID of the process owner. It indicates the user account under which the process is running.

PID: PID stands for Process ID. This column shows the unique identification number assigned to each process by the operating system.

%CPU: This column represents the percentage of CPU (Central Processing Unit) time used by the process since the last update. It indicates the amount of CPU resources being consumed by each process.

%MEM: This column displays the percentage of physical memory (RAM) used by the process. It indicates the memory usage of each process relative to the total available memory.

VSZ: VSZ stands for Virtual Memory Size. It represents the total virtual memory used by a process, including both physical memory (RAM) and swap space.

RSS: RSS stands for Resident Set Size. It indicates the amount of physical memory (RAM) used by a process without considering any shared libraries or memory that may be used by other processes.

TTY: This column displays the terminal associated with the process. If the process is running in the background or doesn't have a terminal, the column will show "?".

STAT: STAT shows the current status of the process. Common statuses include:

R: Running
S: Sleeping
D: Waiting for I/O
Z: Zombie (terminated but still in the process table)
T: Stopped (suspended)
<: High-priority process
N: Low-priority process
+: Process is in the foreground process group of its control terminal
START: This column displays the time when the process started executing. It provides the start time or date for each process.

TIME: The TIME column shows the cumulative CPU time used by the process. It indicates the total amount of CPU time consumed by the process since it started.

COMMAND: This column contains the name of the command or program associated with the process. It represents the actual command that initiated the process.

Note: The "ps -aux" command output may vary slightly between different versions of Unix-like operating systems. Some systems may use slightly different column headers or provide additional columns with specific information.
--------------------------------------

To print specific columns of the "ps -aux" command output using the awk command, you can specify the field numbers you want to display. Here's an example:
- ps -aux | awk '{print $1, $2}'
