If you are using WSL on Windows and in case you are getting some unrelated errors, then you can convert the line endings in the Terraform configuration file to Unix-style using a text editor or a tool like dos2unix. Here's how you can use dos2unix to convert the line endings:

- sudo apt-get install dos2unix
- dos2unix main.tf
