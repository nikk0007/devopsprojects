Cluster Provisioning and Management:

Task: Automate the provisioning of new Kubernetes clusters.
POC: Create scripts or use infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform to spin up clusters on-demand in various cloud providers. Showcase the ease of creating, scaling, and managing clusters.
__________________________________________

Cluster Configuration Management:

Task: Automate cluster configuration to ensure consistency.
POC: Use tools like Helm, Kustomize, or GitOps practices to define and version cluster configurations. Demonstrate how updates to configurations are automated and propagated across clusters.

??? Need to check if we can access other clusters from 1 cluster
_________________________________________________

Continuous Deployment (CD): xx

Task: Set up a CD pipeline for deploying applications to clusters.
POC: Create a CD pipeline using CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Tekton. Show how code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to clusters.

Monitoring and Logging: 

Task: Implement centralized monitoring and logging.
POC: Deploy monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for cluster and application monitoring. Set up centralized logging using tools like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) or Loki.
__________________________________________________

Security and Compliance:

Task: Implement security policies and compliance checks.
POC: Utilize tools like PodSecurityPolicies, Network Policies, and OPA/Gatekeeper to enforce security and compliance policies across clusters. Show how policies are automated and monitored.
Backup and Disaster Recovery:

Task: Implement backup and disaster recovery solutions.
POC: Set up Velero or similar tools to automate cluster backups and recovery. Showcase how clusters can be restored in case of failures.
Scaling and Auto-Scaling:

Task: Implement auto-scaling based on resource usage.
POC: Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler to automatically scale resources based on demand. Show how clusters adapt to workload changes.
Cost Optimization:

Task: Implement cost-saving measures.
POC: Use tools like Kubecost or Cost Management platforms to monitor and optimize cluster costs. Showcase cost trends and savings achieved through automation.
Resource Quotas and Limitations:

Task: Enforce resource quotas and limitations.
POC: Set resource quotas and limits at the namespace level to ensure efficient resource usage. Show how violations are detected and remedied.
GitOps Workflows:

Task: Implement GitOps practices for cluster management.
POC: Use Git-based workflows and tools like ArgoCD or Flux to automate cluster updates. Show how cluster configurations are versioned and applied from Git repositories.
Secrets Management:

Task: Automate secrets management.
POC: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes native secrets management to automate secret provisioning and rotation. Demonstrate how secrets are securely handled.
Backup and Restore for Etcd:

Task: Implement backup and restore for Etcd.
POC: Set up automated Etcd backups and demonstrate how you can restore Kubernetes control plane components in case of failure.
CI/CD Integration:

Task: Integrate CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes clusters.
POC: Integrate CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD with Kubernetes clusters to automate application deployment. Showcase the pipeline's role in managing cluster resources.
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

Task: Use CRDs to automate cluster-specific configurations.
POC: Develop custom CRDs to represent cluster-specific configurations, and create controllers to automate actions based on these CRDs.
Self-Healing:

Task: Implement self-healing mechanisms.
POC: Set up Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes, along with automatic restarts, to demonstrate self-healing in case of application failures.

Centralized Cluster Monitoring:

POC: Set up a centralized monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana) that can gather and display metrics from multiple clusters simultaneously. You can configure alerts, dashboards, and Grafana plugins to provide a unified view of cluster health and performance.
Multi-Cluster Application Deployment:

POC: Create an automation script or tool that deploys applications across multiple clusters using a single command. This can be helpful for rolling out updates or deploying applications to multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
Backup and Restore Across Clusters:

POC: Implement a backup and restore solution that can seamlessly back up applications and data from one cluster and restore them to another. This is valuable for disaster recovery and migration scenarios.
Cluster Scaling and Auto-Scaling:

POC: Develop automation scripts or tools that can scale cluster nodes up or down based on workload demands. You can use cluster autoscaling solutions to dynamically adjust the size of each cluster.
Security Policy Enforcement Across Clusters:

POC: Implement and enforce consistent security policies, such as network policies and pod security policies, across multiple clusters. Use automation to detect and remediate policy violations.
Cluster Updates and Maintenance:

POC: Automate the process of updating Kubernetes clusters, including upgrading the control plane and worker nodes. Ensure that updates are consistent and minimize cluster downtime.
Secrets Management Across Clusters:

POC: Develop a solution for consistent secrets management across clusters. This can include automation for provisioning, rotation, and secure distribution of secrets.
Kubernetes Resource Quota Reporting:

POC: Create a tool that collects and reports on resource usage and quotas for namespaces across multiple clusters. This helps with capacity planning and resource allocation.
Cost Optimization:

POC: Implement a cost optimization solution that tracks and optimizes resource usage and costs across clusters. Visualize cost trends and savings achieved through optimization.
GitOps for Multi-Cluster Management:

POC: Set up a GitOps workflow that manages configurations for multiple clusters from a single Git repository. Use tools like ArgoCD or Flux to automate updates.
Multi-Cluster Disaster Recovery:

POC: Develop and test a disaster recovery plan that can restore the full functionality of multiple clusters in the event of a catastrophic failure. Ensure that data and configurations are backed up and can be recovered.
CI/CD Pipeline for Multi-Cluster Deployment:

POC: Create a CI/CD pipeline that can automatically build, test, and deploy applications to multiple clusters. Ensure that deployments are consistent and have rollback capabilities.
Multi-Cluster Application Rollback:

POC: Develop a rollback mechanism that can quickly revert application updates across multiple clusters in case of issues or failures.
Multi-Cluster Load Balancing and Ingress:

POC: Set up load balancing and ingress controllers that distribute traffic to applications deployed in multiple clusters. Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
Federated Authentication and Authorization:

POC: Implement federated authentication and authorization solutions to provide unified access control and single sign-on (SSO) across multiple clusters.
